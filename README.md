## Description

The aim of this project is to implement x4 upscaling on low-resolution images from the dataset [DIV2K](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/) using three different models:

- Convolutional Autoencoder
- Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN)
- Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (ESRGAN)

## Performance

The metrics used for performance evaluation were Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio ([PSNR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_signal-to-noise_ratio#:~:text=Peak%20signal%2Dto%2Dnoise%20ratio%20(PSNR)%20is%20an,the%20fidelity%20of%20its%20representation.)) and Structural Similarity Index Measure ([SSIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity#:~:text=The%20structural%20similarity%20index%20measure,the%20similarity%20between%20two%20images.)).
